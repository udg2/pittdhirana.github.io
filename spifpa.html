                <b style="color:#FD5D75;">Srinivasa Prasad Gutti</b>, affectionately known as ‘Vasu’ departed from us eight years ago, leaving a legacy of kindness, goodwill and compassion for people as well as an unparalleled passion for the performing
                arts. He had a vision to propagate the South Asian performing arts among North American Youth. His kind, gentle nature and his compassion to help others touched everyone he met and so SPIFPA was formed to fulfill his aspirations.

            <p class="text" style="font-weight:bold;color:#002C6C;margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;text-align:justify;">
                Vasu expressed his passion through his pursuit of Kuchipudi performing art and Karnatic music throughout the 22 years of his life. He earned 'Natya Visarada' title at Kuchipudi Art Academy in Chennai, India. Vasu was also awarded the 2001 Millennium Youth
                Award for his performance at Ravindra Bharathi Cultural Center at Hyderabad, India. He was a founding member of “Case in Point” an A Capella singing group at Case Western Reserve University and was the musical arranger for much of their
                repertoire of songs. He played an active role and directed high school musicals while he was at Kiski School. Vasu was valedictorian and was at the top of his class throughout his academic career. He was also the recipient of the Westinghouse
                Top Family Scholarship during his years at Case and was the recipient of Chairman’s award in Biomedical Engineering there. He accepted admission into CWRU’S MD PhD program with full tuition scholarship and was about to begin his medical
                education during the fall of 2004. He earned several honors and awards for his performing art presentations both in India and in USA.
